Supports Image Audio techniques such as Spectrogram analysis and generation using matplotlib, Image to audio spectrogram conversion, Audio file analysis and Data extraction from audio


### <img src="./misc/for.png"  width=40 height=40> Forensics
Supports File Analysis features such as Metadata extraction, File format detection, Magic number analysis, Compression/Zip detection.

Supports External Tools if you have them installed on your device. Tools such as Steghide, Binwalk, Stegsolve, Zsteg, ExifTool, are required to be installed externally to the SYSTEM PATH for the program to detect and use them.

### <img src="./misc/convert.png"  width=40 height=40> Format Conversion
Includes a Universal Converter for Text format conversion, Multiple input/output format support, Real-time format analysis, Smart format detection

Supported Formats: <b>Text, Hexadecimal, Decimal, Binary, Octal, Base64, Base32, Base16, Base85 </b>


### <img src="./misc/hex.png"  width=40 height=40> Hex Dump Analysis
Supports hex dumb analysis, editing and saving edited files for supported files formats. 
Also has support to automatically suggest fix for common headers using hex dump of corrupt files for various formats.

### <img src="./misc/auto.png"  width=40 height=40> Auto Tab
Includes a one click solution auto tab to automatically find a general or user specified text/string format within the input text/file automatically using various techniques at once and return the string if found. The auto tab may not be able to find flags/strings requiring multiple steps or advanced tools.
